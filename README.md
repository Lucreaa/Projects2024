Ensure that you have all the files:
	- The system itself
	- PlayerList.txt
	- LoginDetails.txt
	- PlayerStats.txt

Ensure that the files are saved to the same directory as the python file.

If you wish to use a universal login before creating an account:
	- Fan: Username = admin, Password = admin
	- Player: Username = admin, Password = admin
	- Official: Username = admin, Password = admin
	- Coach: Username = admin, Password = admin

If you decide on creating account, you can use the new details to login after you have created an account.

Please ensure you are deleting an account that is not mentioned above as a universal login.

If you wish to view the stats of a player that has just been added, their stats will appear as 0 before being appended.

You must login as a coach to add a player, then as an official to update their stats.

Players already within the database can have their stats updated at any time.
